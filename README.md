## about

I have been doing this since forever and I'll keep doing it forever.

- leveraging AI everywhere (agentic workflows / langchain / building **insane** prompts)
- building and using TUIs
- most of my repos either miss a remote or use my local gitea

**Currently building with:**

- node / bun
- python + fastapi
- react + tanstack
- k8s + proxmox
- L2/L3 networking
- c++ (sfml imgui boost asio libuv lua luajit blablabla)
- hardware hacking (SBCs for IoT, random aliexpress chips)
- there's more but that is enough, right
